Abstract class & interface we can achieved Data Abstraction
 if we used abstract class we cannot achieved 100% data abstraction but using interface we can achieved 100% Data Abstra
Interface- provide both data hidding and  Data Abstration(invisible)	

-------------
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details 
and showing only functionality to the user.
- privacy & security

Interface
-------------
An interface is a blue print of class.
Interface contains final & Static variables by default. we cannot create normal variable
Interface contains abstract methods.( also allowed default methods & Static methods from java8 onwards)
An abstract method is a method contains definition but not body(Un-implemented method).
 void m();   // abstract method
Methods in interface are by default public.
Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
We can define interface with interface keyword.
A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface but aÂ class implements an interface.
We can create Object reference for Interface but we cannot instantiate interface(object creation).
 
-We used the interface onces we know the req(what) but does not know the design(how) 
 - will create interface & in interface will create abstract method & later onces design is know by using class wil implement interface

visiblity prefrence
public
default- by default in class methods are defaults
